# SimpleReactWithExpress
A boilerplate project to be used in future projects. This project attempts to avoid using create-react-app and create-react-app-express to avoid unnecessary modules and other add-ons. Building this has also helped me get a better understanding of what goes on under the covers and a deeper understanding of webpack development and production configs.
